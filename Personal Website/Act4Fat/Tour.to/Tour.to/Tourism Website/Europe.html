	<h2><b>Venice Canals, Italy</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>

	<h2><b>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
The Leaning Tower of Pisa (La Torre Pendente) is just one of many attractions in 
the city of Pisa, one whose world fame comes not from the considerable elegance 
of its design, but from a flaw. Work began on the tower in the 1100s, and the sinking, 
which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story.

Leaning more and more over the centuries, before restoration work in the 1990s, 
it was predicted to topple over by the year 2000. Today, visitors can climb up the 
stairs of the tower for a fabulous view over the city.

The Leaning Tower stands on the Piazza dei Miracoli, a setting it shares with the 
beautiful Romanesque Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and a round freestanding baptistery.
Each of these features outstanding works of medieval stone carving.

	<h2><b>Cinque Terre</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
Cinque Terre is a lovely coastal region with steep hills and sheer cliffs overlooking the 
Mediterranean. The five picturesque villages of Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, 
Manarola, and Riomaggiore can be reached by several means, joined to each other by walking 
paths, a railroad that tunnels through the headlands to emerge at each town, or a scenic narrow 
road high on the hillside above.

Hiking between the villages is one of the most popular things to do as it gives travelers the 
chance to enjoy the landscape. The small towns have maintained a feel of old-world fishing 
villages and offer a sense of remoteness even in the face of modern tourism. Because landslides
can close portions of the trail, it is important to check current conditions before planning a hike.

		<h1 align="center">Wonders of Keukenhof Lisse, Oude Haven Rotterdam, and Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam</h1>
	<h2><b>Keukenhof, Lisse</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
Think of the Netherlands, and you'll inevitably think of tulips, the country's most 
popular flower. And one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Netherlands 
showcases these and other spring bulbs in spectacular abundance. Given its handy 
location relative to Amsterdam — it's a 45-minute drive away, or just under an hour 
by public transit — it makes for a fun and easy day trip from the country's largest 
city.

Keukenhof, otherwise known as the "Garden of Europe," is located on the outskirts of 
the town of Lisse in what's widely considered the "bulb belt" of the Netherlands. The 
largest public garden in the world, it boasts more than 70 acres of what was once the 
former kitchen (or "keuken") garden of a large country estate, Keukenhof displays more 
than 700 varieties of tulips, which are at their height in April and May.

	<h2><b>Oude Haven, Rotterdam</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
Located an easy one-hour train ride from Amsterdam, the port city of Rotterdam is well 
worth visiting for its well-preserved Old Harbour, or Oude Haven. The city has a long 
and rich maritime history thanks largely to its location on the Nieuwe Maas, an arm of 
the Rhine River, and its proximity to the English Channel.

Part of Rotterdam's superb Maritime District, Oude Haven is ideal for those who enjoy 
seeing the sights on foot. The harbor is chock-full of old houseboats and sailing ships, 
many of them on display at the Maritime Museum Rotterdam.

In addition to the 20 or so historic vessels on display in the water, a variety of indoor 
displays can also be enjoyed, including a replica of a vessel dating back over 2,000 years.
	</h3></p></pre>



	<h2><b>Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
As befits one of the world's greatest artists, the spectacular Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam 
is ranked an impressive #2 in a leading list of the top art museums globally, attracting 
almost 1.5 million visitors each year.

Home to the world's largest collection of Van Gogh paintings — many donated by the artist's 
family — this impressive gallery and museum was specially built to showcase the more than 200 
paintings, 500 drawings, and 700 letters in its vast collection.

Works by his contemporaries are also on display. A highlight is participating in the museum's 
new "Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience," which offers a fascinating, high-tech, interactive look 
at the artist's life and times, as well as his best-known work.

If the city's excellent museums are your priority, you may in fact want to consider visiting 
them off-season during the quieter, cooler times of year. Given that both these popular attractions are things to do indoors and easy to get to via the city's excellent public transit, it's easy to 
keep warm, and the city's climate is relatively mild, even in winter.

		<h1 align="center"><b>Wonders of The Matterhorn, Lake Geneva, and St. Moritz</h1></b>
	<h2><b>The Matterhorn</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
You'll never forget the first time you see Switzerland's most symbolic mountain, the Matterhorn. 
Maybe you arrive in the charming village of Zermatt, at its base, on a clear blue day and the 
4,478-meter high, tooth-shaped mountain looms clearly in front of you. Or maybe it is spitting 
rain when you first set foot in the car-free town, and it isn't until the next morning that you 
witness the emblematic peak emerging from a sea of dissipating clouds. Whichever way you first 
see this legendary mountain, it will remain seared into your memory for years to come. It's that 
impressive.

One of the highest mountains in the Alps, the Matterhorn sits on the border with Italy. It has 
four steep faces rising to its craggy tip. Climbers have been intrigued by this mountain from the 
first successful summit in 1865 by British climber Edward Whymper and his team. The trip still 
ended tragically when four of the climbers fell to their deaths during the descent.

Today, thousands of experienced climbers come here in a summit bid each summer. There are several 
routes to the top of this mountain, which is not accessible by cable car. The easiest route is the 
Hörnligrat, which begins in Zermatt.

	<h2><b>Lake Geneva</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
Lake Geneva, Europe's largest Alpine lake, straddles the Swiss/French border, and laps at the shores 
of some of Switzerland's most popular cities. The city of Geneva (in French Genève; in German Genf) 
its between pretty snowcapped peaks at the point where the Rhône spills into Lake Geneva.

This French-speaking "capital of peace" is the European seat of the United Nations and exudes a pleasing 
blend of French joie de vivre and Swiss structure. Promenades, parks, and gardens surround the lake, 
and the old town is a lovely spot to stroll among the historic buildings. The Jet d'Eau, a fountain 
in Lake Geneva shooting water 150 meters into the air, is a famous landmark. Cultural attractions include 
the Opera House and the Grand Théâtre, which stages international acts.

Also on the lake, about 62 kilometers from Geneva, Lausanne boasts lovely views over the surrounding 
region and the lake, with the Alps rising in the distance. Take a stroll through the medieval old 
town with its cute cafés and boutiques and stunning Gothic cathedral. At the foot of the Alps, on 
Lake Geneva, Montreux hosts the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival in June/July.

	<h2><b>St. Moritz</h2></b>
	<h3><p><pre>
St. Moritz is a city of firsts. The world's first electric light clicked on here in December 1878. 
In 1889 it hosted the Alps' first golf tournament and in 1935 began operating one of Switzerland's 
first ski lifts. Additionally, the town is considered the birthplace of Alpine winter tourism after 
a hotelier convinced British summer guests to winter here in 1864. It went on to host the Winter 
Olympics twice (1928 and 1948).

In the Upper Engadin region in southeast Switzerland, in a valley surrounded by the Alps, today it 
is one of the world's most ritzy ski resorts, favored by billionaires and celebrities. It has 350 
kilometers of ski and snowboard runs with some of Switzerland's steepest terrain.

Winter sports run the gamut, from skiing, snowboarding, skating, and bobsledding to tobogganing. 
One of the oldest natural ice runs for toboggans on the planet is found here, the famous 
1.2-kilometer-long Cresta Run. There is also a snowboard fun park and 150 kilometers of winter walking 
and cross-country ski trails.
