							the city of Pisa, one whose world fame comes not from the considerable elegance 
							of its design, but from a flaw. Work began on the tower in the 1100s, and the sinking, 
							which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story.</p>

							Mediterranean. The five picturesque villages of Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, 
							Manarola, and Riomaggiore can be reached by several means, joined to each other by walking 
							paths, a railroad that tunnels through the headlands to emerge at each town, or a scenic narrow 
							road high on the hillside above. </p>

							worth visiting for its well-preserved Old Harbour, or Oude Haven. The city has a long

							In 1889 it hosted the Alps' first golf tournament and in 1935 began operating one of Switzerland's 
							first ski lifts. Additionally, the town is considered the birthplace of Alpine winter tourism after 
							a hotelier convinced British summer guests to winter here in 1864.  </p>
